import Foundation

/// Coalesces and defers `.ghosttyDidFocusSurface` focus broadcasts so that emitting
/// one mid-mutation can never synchronously re-enter the focus/selection path.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// `Workspace.applyTabSelectionNow` mutates a large amount of `@Published` selection
/// state and, historically, finished by posting `.ghosttyDidFocusSurface`
/// *synchronously*. The Combine `.onReceive` subscriber in `ContentView` delivers
/// that notification synchronously on the posting thread and reacts by calling back
/// into `TabManager.focusTab` → `Workspace.focusPanel` → `applyTabSelectionNow`,
/// which posts the notification again. Because the only re-entrancy guard
/// (`Workspace.isApplyingTabSelection`) is *per-instance*, a cycle that bounces
/// through SwiftUI body re-evaluation and across different `Workspace` instances
/// (command-palette focus restore + cross-workspace handoff) was unbounded. That is
/// the 426s main-thread hang in https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5100.
///
/// ## Contract
///
/// - ``emit(_:)`` never delivers synchronously. It records the latest payload and
///   schedules a single flush on the main queue, so all `@Published` mutations made
///   by the caller settle before any observer runs.
/// - Multiple emits before a flush coalesce to the most recent payload.
/// - If an observer synchronously emits again during delivery, that emit updates the
///   pending payload instead of recursing; the active flush drains it in a bounded
///   loop (at most ``maxCoalescedDeliveries`` deliveries per turn). If the cycle has
///   not settled within that bound, the still-pending payload is carried to a fresh
///   scheduled flush rather than delivered synchronously or dropped — so work stays
///   bounded per runloop turn (the app keeps responding) while the final selection is
///   never lost. A notification-driven focus cycle can therefore no longer hang.
///
/// The type is fully testable without AppKit: inject ``deliver`` to capture
/// broadcasts, and inject ``schedule`` to drive flushes deterministically.
