/// Regression coverage for https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5032.
///
/// The Project Worktrees sidebar `+` button created the worktree on disk but
/// the workspace tab exited immediately, because the worktree setup command was
/// passed as the workspace's primary process (`initialTerminalCommand`). A
/// workspace closes the moment its main process exits, so the setup command
/// finishing (or failing) killed the tab. The fix routes setup through
/// `initialTerminalInput` so the workspace's main process stays the login shell.
