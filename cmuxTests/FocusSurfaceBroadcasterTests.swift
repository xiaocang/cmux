/// Regression coverage for the focus-broadcast re-entrancy hang (issue #5100).
///
/// Production symptom: `Workspace.applyTabSelectionNow` posted
/// `.ghosttyDidFocusSurface` *synchronously* while `@Published` selection state was
/// mid-mutation. The Combine `.onReceive` subscriber in `ContentView` received it on
/// the posting thread and synchronously re-entered the focus path
/// (`attemptCommandPaletteFocusRestoreIfNeeded` → `TabManager.focusTab` →
/// `Workspace.focusPanel` → `applyTabSelectionNow` → post again). The only guard
/// (`Workspace.isApplyingTabSelection`) is per-instance, so a cycle that bounced
/// through SwiftUI body re-evaluation and across workspace instances was unbounded —
/// a 426s main-thread hang.
///
/// ``FocusSurfaceBroadcaster`` is the fix seam: emitting a focus broadcast is now
/// deferred + coalesced and a re-entrant emit during delivery is drained in a bounded
/// loop instead of recursing. These tests exercise that contract directly, without
/// AppKit, by injecting a manual scheduler and capturing deliveries.
